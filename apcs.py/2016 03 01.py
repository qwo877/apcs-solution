'''
Problem Simplified:
Given a sequence of numbers, find the first number lower than 60 and the first number higher than 60 (in terms of index: i.e., index of 60 Â± 1).
If no number higher than 60 is found, output "worst case".
If no number lower than 60 is found, output "best case".
The first line of output must contain the sorted sequence.

a = int(input())
b = list(map(int, input().split()))
c = sorted(b)
d = next((f for f in c if f >= 60), None)  # Find the first number in list `c` that is greater than or equal to 60. 
                                          # If no such number exists, return `None`.

e = next((f for f in reversed(c) if f < 60), None)  # Find the first number in the reversed list `c` that is less than 60.
                                                    # Effectively, this gets the last number in `c` that is less than 60.
                                                    # If no such number exists, return `None`.

else:
